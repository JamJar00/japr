# Health Check
A health check for your projects

## TODO
### Fundamentals
- Find a way to add suppressions

### Checks
- Has CI (that matches remote)
- Has linter
- Check lock files are checked into Git

#### Python
- Avoid setup.py/setup.cfg in favour of pyproject.toml?

#### Sketchy Ideas
- Has link to Docker if it has a Docker artifact
- Has git tags for versions?
  - Versions in project files match latest git tag
